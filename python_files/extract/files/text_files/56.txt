Preface
This completely new dictionary of Business English has been
specially written to be of practical use for students of business
and experienced business people who need to read, write and
speak English in their work, and for those who give them
language training and advice.
It is intended for learners of English at intermediate to
advanced level. The definitions have been written using the
Oxford 3000™ so that they are simple and clear, but accurate
and detailed.
To ensure that the material included in the dictionary is as
up-to-date and authentic as possible, a new 50 million word
corpus of business English was used. This is a collection of written
and spoken British and American English taken from various
sources such as the business sections of newspapers, business
journals and textbooks, and interviews with business people.
It has enabled a wide range of business areas to be covered in the
dictionary in addition to terms that are of more general use in
communicating in English in a business context.
As people studying English for business need to know how to
use words correctly as well as what they mean, detailed grammar
information has been included and examples that show how a
term is used in typical contexts. In addition, for terms that are
commonly used there is extensive information about collocation,
for example verbs that can be used with a particular noun.
1 000 words in the dictionary are marked with a star to
show that they are particularly important in Business English.
These are words that are frequent on our business corpus and are
essential in most areas of business or combine with many others
to make compounds.
During the writing of the dictionary we have been advised
by teachers of Business English and by people involved in the
world of business. I should like to thank the members of the
Said Business School in Oxford who helped us in an advisory
capacity on various areas of business, especially Burcu Hacibedel
(Banking, Finance and Economics) and Doris Schedlitzki
(Management and Human Resources). I am also grateful to
the other people who gave us their expert advice, including
Tony Ereira (Stock Exchange and Finance), Richard Spraggett
(Accounting) and Roberta Wedge (Finance and Management).
I would also like to acknowledge the invaluable work of the
large team of people who have been involved in the dictionary
at various stages, both before and after the text was complete.

people or companies that buy things, while
consumei and clientele are used about people.

is a standard product or service: Phone
companies are competing to sign up domestic
customers.

MORE ABOUT
Emission units
Under the Kyoto Protocol, countries are given a
number of emission units equal to the maximum
amount of harmful gases they are allowed to
produce. Countries that produce a smaller amount
than their limit can sell units to countries that
produce more than their limit. Countries can also
earn units, for example by planting trees or
helping other countries to use technologies that
use energy more efficiently.
All units are the same size and can be traded in
the same way. But some people distinguish units
that are earned from those that are given by
calling them carbon credits or emission credits
rather than emission units.
Emission credit is also used to describe the units
of systems other than the Kyoto Protocol, for
example the system in the US to reduce sulphur
dioxide pollution.

Idiomatic language in Business English
As you use this dictionary, you will see
many explanations of idioms that are used
frequently in Business English. When we
use the term 'idiom', people often think of
colourful expressions such as sell like hot
cakes or bring home the bacon. However,
the English language also includes
many thousands of less obviously colourful
expressions. We use these expressions
every day in speech and writing, often
without even noticing them. The language
of business is no exception to this. Consider
the following examples of Business
English:
Investors are worried about the health
of the economy.
The company is at risk ofgoing under.
The dollar has gained ground against
the euro.
These examples all use idiomatic language.
In the first example, the economy is being
seen as a human body, which can be
healthy or unhealthy. In the second, a
company that is failing is seen as
a sinking ship, going under the waves. And
in the third, it is as though the currencies
are in a race, with the euro being ahead but
the dollar catching up.
Common themes
Ifwe look at the language people use when
speaking and writing about business, we
can see that certain themes are repeated
over and over again.
Sport, games and war
The themes of sport, games and war are
some of the most frequent. This is not
surprising. Business is all about
competition, so it is natural that when
people speak and write about businesses
competing they should select expressions
related to other areas of human activity
that involve success and failure, victory
and defeat.
Companies compete with rival
companies to be the best and most
successful in their field, just as athletes
and sportsmen and women compete to
win a race or a match. If competition is
fierce, rival businesses are even seen as
being like opposing countries or armies,
where the survival of one seems to require
the destruction of another. Businesses and
the people in charge of them are often
described as players, and business leaders
are portrayed as captains or generals,
developing strategy, directing operations,
attacking the enemy, or encouraging their
troops. The themes ofwar and sport run
through the following piece about
competition between supermarket
companies (some of the idiomatic
expressions are explained below)

• to play for high stakes:
to risk a lot of money on being
the most successful
• the nation's shopping trolleys:
the retail industry
• to target: to choose to attack
somebody
• to outstrip: to become faster,
better or more successful than
a competitor
• the top spot: the first position in
a competition
Supermarket giants
battle for top place
Britain's two biggest supermarkets
are playing for high stakes in their
battle to control the nation's shopping
trolleys. The food retailing giants have
targeted some of their smaller rivals,
with one or more hostile takeovers pre-
dicted in the coming months. Control
of one or more of the smaller regional
chains would allow either group
to
comfortably outstrip their rivals and
claim the top spot in British retailing.
Vehicles and machines
Another theme that occurs frequently in
Business English is that of businesses being
described in terms of vehicles or machines.
Again, these seem to be quite natural
images. Like many machines, businesses
are complicated things made up of many
different parts that all have to work
well at the same time. They have to
move forwards in order to survive, and
movement is the defining characteristic of
vehicles. Have a look at the following text:
The writer has used several idioms relating
to vehicles and machinery to describe
the company's problems and recovery.
When the company was having problems it
was like a train that had left the tracks as
the result of an accident; like a car on a bad
road it was having a bumpy ride.
Its activities then suddenly stopped: when
a train hits the buffers, it hits the barrier at
the end of a railway line. Production
ground to a halt like a machine that stops
working or a vehicle that stops moving.
Now it has recovered, it is back on track.
Business leaders are often described in
terms of pilots or drivers, directing and
controlling the progress of the business,
and here the management team is in the
driving seat, firmly in control.
Health
The theme of health also features strongly
in Business English. People will often
describe a business, an industry or an
economy as if it were a living thing with a
state of health. Its condition is seen to
improve or worsen in the same way that a
person's health does, and it often needs a
particular treatment in order to regain its
health. The following examples use the
theme of health:
We're a leaner, fitter business than we
were a year ago.
She admits that the company is
bleeding cash on the project.
Ifbanks tighten their lending policies,
healthyfirms may be starved of credit.
*» The risks of the economy suffering a
relapse are high.
An urgent plan is needed to revive the
ailing manufacturing industry.
The airline is seeking an injection
offunds from shareholders.
When you are reading or listening to
people talking about business in English,
look out for the kinds of themes and
idioms we have discussed here. It will
make your studies more interesting, and
help increase your understanding of
what Business English is all about.
Train parts manufacturer
back on track
Troubled train parts manufacturer
Railparts is back on track.The
company, which makes high-tech
components for high-speed trains,
has had a bumpy ride over the past
few years. Already under pressure
from foreign competitors, the
company hit the buffers when a
prolonged industrial dispute saw
production at its Scottish plant grind
to a halt late last year. Now, with a
new productivity agreement in
place and new management in the
driving seat, the business looks to be
on track to return to profitability by
the third quarter of this year.

Computers and the Internet
In order to be able to run programs,
a computer uses an operating system, such
as Windows or Linux. Once this is installed,
applications can be loaded to perform
particular functions, such as:
• a word processesor for working
with text
• a spreadsheet for working with figures
• a database for working with details of
customers, products, etc.
• a CAD program for design
• a desktop publishing program for
creating brochures, posters, etc.
If your computer is on a network, you will
have to enter your username and
password before you can use it. You will
then see the programs on your computer
displayed as icons on the desktop.
To open a program, click (or double-
click) on the icon, and the program will
open in a new window. Use the drop-down
menu on the menu toolbar to open an
existing document or to create a new one.
If you create a new document, save it to
your hard disk so that you wont lose it if
the computer crashes.

When you have entered text or data in the
program, you can edit or format it in a
number of ways:
• You can use the menus or icons at the top
of the screen to delete it, to cut and
paste it, etc.
• You can right-click ( = click the right-
hand button on your mouse) and select
an option from the pop-up menu.
• You can also use keyboard shortcuts to
perform many functions, such as
Ctrl-C to copy text, or Ctrl-P to print out
a document.
To move text around, you can highlight
it, then click and drag it with the mouse.
To move to another part of a document,
use the scroll bar to scroll up or down,
and click to position the cursor where
you want it.
When you have a lot of files on your
computer, you should back them up, for
example by uploading them onto a server,
or by burning them onto a CD-ROM. In
order to take up less space, you may want
to zip/compress the files first.

To send an email, write the address of the
recipient in the To: field, or click on an
address from your address book. If you
want to copy someone in on the email, put
their address in the Cc: (carbon copy) field,
or in the Bcc: (blind carbon copy) field if you
don't want the recipient to know who is
copied in. If you need to attach a document
to the email, select Attach file from the
menu, or click on the paperclip icon, and
then browse your computer for the
document you want to attach.
To say the email address:
j_martin@martin-wood.com
you would say 'j underscore martin at
martin hyphen wood dot com'
The Internet
In order to search for information on the
Internet, open your browser (for example
Microsoft Internet Explorer, Netscape or
Mozilla), and type some keywords into the
Search box of whatever search engine you
use (for example Yahoo! or Google). Ifyou
want to find the names of interpreters who
work in New York, for example, you could
type in the keywords interpreters and "New
York" (in double quotes to keep these words
together), and then click on one of the
websites that the search brings up.
To open a web page, click on a link, or
type the page's URL into the address bar
at the top of the screen, and the page will
download.
If you want to save the address of a
website that you have searched for
orjust come across by chance, you
can bookmark it.
The URL of a company's home page is
often something like:
http://www.martinwood.com
To read this URL to somebody over the
phone, you would say:
i
'h-t-t-p colon, twoforward slashes,
double-u double-u double-u dot,
martinwood (all one word), dotcom'
The .com in the example above is called
a top-level domain. Common ones
include:
.com /,dnt 'knm/ (AmE /,da:t 'ka:m/)
- this is used by businesses
.org /.dot 'o:g/ (AmE/,da:t 'o:rg/)
- used by organizations that are not
businesses
.edu /,dnt 'edju:/ (AmE ,da:t 'edju:/

- used by colleges, universities, etc.
.gov /.dot 'qav/ (AmE/,da:t 'qav/
- used by government bodies
.net/.dDt 'net/ (AmE /,da:t 'net/)
- used especially by Internet service
providers
Most countries have their own domain
ending, and this is usually pronounced
as separate letters, for example Bulgaria
is .bg/,dot bi: 'd3i:/, and China is
.cn/.dotsi: 'en/.
Common UK domain names include:
.co.uk/dDt.kao dntju: 'kei/
- this is often used by companies
.ac.uk /dot ,aek dntju: 'kei/
- used by universities

Writing letters, emails and memos
Business letters are written in a formal style: you
should avoid short forms and informal expressions.
A lot of modern business communication takes place by
email. Emails are generally less formal in style than letters,
but emails to customers and suppliers are more formal
than emails between colleagues. Memos are used for
communication within companies and range from
formal to informal depending on the subject. Business
faxes use a similar style to formal letters.

0 Dear Ms Wedgwood
0 Sales enquiry
Thank you for your recent enquiry concerning
the possibility of selling our traditional handmade
wooden furniture through your stores.
I amO pleased to enclose a copy of our catalogue and
current price list. In addition to the designs shown, we
will shortly be producing a range of storage units, for
which a catalogue will be available next month. Each
item is made to order, so there is usually a period of
four to six weeks between ordering and delivery.
Please let me know if you require any further
information or if I can be of assistance in any way.
If you are in the area and would like to visit us, I
would be delighted to show you around our
workshop.
I look forward to hearing from you.

O Often there is a letterhead printed
on the paper, which can appear
anywhere at the top of the page.
Otherwise, the sender's address
and other details (phone number,
fax, email address, etc.) usually go
on the right-hand side.
0
If the letter to which you are
replying has a reference, often
made up of initials, a date, an
account number, etc., this can be
included at Yourref. Include any
reference that you want to
be used in the response to your
letter at Our ref. The references
can go either on the right- or
left-hand side.
0 The date can also go on the right
or the left. British style is to put
the day, then the month, then the
year. American style is to have the
month before the day {June 26,
2005 or 6-26-2005). In order to
avoid confusion,
it is best to write
the month out in full rather than
use figures.
© The address of the person
receiving the letter goes on the
left of the page.
If you know their
name and job title, put them
before the address. Alternatively,
you can put the name or job title
on a new line after the address
and use the expression for the
attention of (often shortened to
fao): For the attention of the
Marketing Director
0 There are various ways of starting
a letter.
If you know the name of
the person you are writing to,
start with Dear Mr/Mrs/Ms/Dr.
.

and the person's surname.
If you
do not have the name of a specific
person, you can address the
letter: Dear Sir/Madam, Dear Sir
or Madam (in British English) or
To whom it may concern (in
American English). Dear Sirs is
used, especially in British English,
when addressing a company
rather than a particular person.
In American English, a letter to
a company usually starts with
© Encl.
Gentlemen. In British English,
you can choose whether to put
a comma after the name
(Dear Ms Wedgwood, or
Dear Ms Wedgwood).
In American English,
it
is usual to put a colon
{Dear Mr Smith:).
0 You can mention the subject
of your letter in a title.
It is not
necessary to begin the title
with Re (short for 'concerning').
© Avoid using short forms: use
I am rather than I'm.
Formal emails
0
It is usual to separate
paragraphs with a line space.
0
If the letter starts with Dear
Sir/Madam or Dear Sirs, the
usual ending in British English
is Yours faithfully.
If you write
to a named person
it is Yours
sincerely. In American English,
the endings Sincerely or
Sincerely yours can be used,
whether or not you write to a
named person. You can
choose whether to put a
comma after this [Yours
sincerely, or Yours sincerely).
fli) Your signature is followed
by your printed name.
If
the letter is signed by
one person on behalf of
another, pp is used before
the printed name.
®
It is a good idea to include
your job title, especially
if you
have not dealt with the person
you are writing to before.
© End. stands for Enclosed or
Enclosure(s):
it means that
there are other documents
sent with the letter.

Dear Sir/Madam
We are a Birmingham-based software development
firm specializing in custom-made data systems.
Your hotel has been recommended to us as
a suitable venue for our annual sales conference.
The dates are 25-27th October and we would
require accommodation for between 12 and 15
people, including all meals from dinner on 25th
to lunch on 27th. We would also require the use
of two conference rooms, with the usual facilities.
Can you please let me know before the end of the
week whether you can offer this kind of
accommodation, and what your rates are?
Many thanks

O Header information: This
includes who the message is
to and from, and what
it is
about. Cc ('carbon copies') is
for the email addresses of
anyone you want to send
copies to.
© Message text: Even formal
emails are often less formal
than letters. Sometimes there
is no opening greeting, and
phrases like Many thanks or
Regards are often used
instead of the more formal
Yours faithfully or Yours
sincerely, especially after the
initial exchange of emails.
Although a more informal
tone may be appropriate,
particularly when writing to
someone you deal with
regularly, you should still use
correct spelling, grammar and
punctuation. Avoid using
whole words in capitals
(URGENT), which may be
interpreted as shouting.
If you
want to stress a word you can
use asterisks on either side
of
it: *urgent*

O You can start an email with
Hi or Hello (with or without the
person's name) or just with their
first name: Janie. People often
start with no greeting at all,
especially if they have emailed
each other recently and are
continuing the same topic.
© In an email to someone you
know well
it is appropriate to use
informal language and a tone
similar to that of conversation.
Short forms are acceptable {I'm
instead of
I am).
Q Informal emails can be fairly free
in their punctuation, although
it still advisable to write full
sentences with initial capital
letters and full stops. An email
without basic punctuation may
be seen as rushed or
unprofessional.
O Abbreviations such as
btw {by the way), fyi
{for your information)
are commonly used.
0 Best is short for Best wishes.
Other possible ways to end
are Regards, All the best, or
Yours (slightly more formal).

Writing a CV or resume
The principal differences between
a CV and a resume are:
• A CV is a complete record of your
professional and academic history,
together with a summary of your skills;
a resume is a summary of the experience
and strengths that you have that are
relevant to the particularjob you are
applying for.
• A resume is usually one page, except for
very senior posts; a CV can be longer
than this.
•
It is unusual to include personal
information such as your birth date,
marital status, etc. on a resume;
this information is optional on a CV.
•
It is common to include the names and
contact details of your referees on a CV,
but rare to do so on a resume.
CVs are moving closer to the model
of the US resume, in that it is now becoming
common to summarize your experience
and strengths in the Profile (also called
the Career summary) section.

MORE ABOUT
Takeovers and mergers
A takeover is when a company offers to buy all or
most of the shares of another company. The
company being bought may be bigger or smaller
than the company offering to buy
it, and the
owners of both companies may or may not agree
about the conditions of the sale.
If they do agree,
the takeover is friendly.
If not,
it becomes a
hostile takeover.
A merger involves two companies of a similar size
agreeing to join together and become a single
company. This can involve a takeover in which
one company buys the other's shares and pays for
these with some of its own shares, or the owners
of both companies can agree to exchange their
shares for shares in a new company.

Pronunciation and phonetic symbols
Phonetic symbols are used to show the
pronunciation of single word headwords
such as ring /nrj/. They are also used for
any unusual or difficult words that form
part of a phrase (= a headword with two
or more words) such as .Ansoff 'matrix
/'aenznf; AmE -zo:f/. For most phrases, the
pronunciation is not given but the typical
stress of the phrase is marked (see below
for stress in phrases).

Stress
A syllable is part of a word that has one
vowel sound and usually one or more
consonants, for example stock has one
syllable and economics has four syllables.
When a syllable is stressed {= emphasized
when speaking) it appears louder and longer
than other syllables and can be noticed by
changes in how high or low the voice is.
The mark/7 is placed before the syllable
with the strongest stress (= primary stress).
For example, in the word moonlight
/'muinlait/ the first syllable is stressed while
in expense /ik'spens/ the second syllable is
stressed. Longer words with more than two
syllables often have a secondary stress which
is marked /./
. The secondary stress is weaker
than the primary stress, for example
integration /.mti'greijn/.

British English and
American English
If there is a difference between British
English and American English in the
pronunciation of a word, then the British
English form is usually given first with
AmE written before the American
pronunciation. For example:
quarterly /'kwaitali; AmE 'kwoirtarli/

If only part of a word is pronounced
differently then only the part that is
different is shown. Hyphens (-) represent
the rest Of the word. For example:
grocery /'grausari; AmE 'grou-/
Derivatives
Derivatives are normally either the same
as the headword or are formed by adding a
suffix to the headword. They usually have
the same pronunciation as the headword,
plus the suffix if this is needed. Common
suffixes include: -ly (/-li/), -ness (/-nas/), etc.
The pronunciation is not usually shown
and only the stress of the derivative is
marked. For example:
illicit A'lisit/ adjective
illicitly adverb
However, if it is not clear how a derivative
should be pronounced, then the
pronunciation is shown:
statistic /sta'tistik/ noun
statistical /sta'tistikl/ adjective
Weak forms and strong forms
Certain very common words, such as
for, of and to have a strong and a weak
pronunciation depending on whether
they are stressed or not. As an example,
for can be pronounced /fo:(r)/ [stressed] or
/fa(r)/ [unstressed). When these words are
used in phrases, such as .letter of 'credit
/.letar av 'kredit/ or B-to-B /,bi: ta 'bi:/,
they are not usually stressed and so the
weak form is used.
Stress in phrases
A phrase will often have more than one
stress. For example in .standard devi ation
there are two stresses. When the phrase is
said on its own, the stress on devi ation is
stronger so this is marked as the primary
stress. Many examples with two important
words, such as .systematic 'risk and
.carbon 'copy, have a secondary stress
followed by a primary stress.
Sometimes the main stress is not on
the last word of a phrase. For example,
in 'press kit the main stress is on press.
Notice that kit is unmarked. Secondary
stress is only marked after the primary
stress when there is a word of two
syllables or more, for example 'press
communi, cations.
The stress patterns we have given on
phrases are the recommended ones,
but you may occasionally hear others.
For example, the stress may change when
phrases are combined with other words.
The main stress in the first phrase may
move to the place of the secondary stress
to avoid two stressed syllables being next
to each other. For instance, .duty-'free has
the main stress on free, but in the phrase
.duty-free 'shops the stress on free is
missing.
Longer phrases, with more than two
important words, are generally shown
with several primary stresses. In this case,
the last primary stress should always be
made the main stress. For example in
foreign di'rect investment there are three
fairly equal stresses, but the main
emphasis in pronunciation should come
on investment.
