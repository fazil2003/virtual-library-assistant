Hacking has been a part of computing for almost five decades and it is a very broad 
discipline, which covers a wide range of topics. The first known event of hacking had taken 
place in 1960 at MIT and at the same time, the term "Hacker" was originated. 
Hacking is the act of finding the possible entry points that exist in a computer system or 
a computer network and finally entering into them. Hacking is usually done to gain 
unauthorized access to a computer system or a computer network, either to harm the 
systems or to steal sensitive information available on the computer. 
Hacking is usually legal as long as it is being done to find weaknesses in a computer or 
network system for testing purpose. This sort of hacking is what we call Ethical Hacking. 
A computer expert who does the act of hacking is called a "Hacker". Hackers are those 
who seek knowledge, to understand how systems operate, how they are designed, and 
then attempt to play with these systems. 
Types of Hacking 
We can segregate hacking into different categories, based on what is being hacked. Here 
is a set of examples:  
 
Website Hacking: Hacking a website means taking unauthorized control over a 
web server and its associated software such as databases and other interfaces. 
 
 
Network Hacking: Hacking a network means gathering information about a 
network by using tools like Telnet, NS lookup, Ping, Tracert, Netstat, etc. with the 
intent to harm the network system and hamper its operation. 
 
 
Email Hacking: It includes getting unauthorized access on an Email account and 
using it without taking the consent of its owner.  
 
 
Ethical Hacking: Ethical hacking involves finding weaknesses in a computer or 
network system for testing purpose and finally getting them fixed. 
 
 
Password Hacking: This is the process of recovering secret passwords from data 
that has been stored in or transmitted by a computer system. 
 
 
Computer Hacking: This is the process of stealing computer ID and password by 
applying hacking methods and getting unauthorized access to a computer system. 
Advantages of Hacking 
Hacking is quite useful in the following scenarios: 
 
To recover lost information, especially in case you lost your password. 
 
 
To perform penetration testing to strengthen computer and network security. 
 
 
To put adequate preventative measures in place to prevent security breaches. 
1. Ethical Hacking − Overview 
Ethical Hacking 
2 
 
 
To have a computer system that prevents malicious hackers from gaining access. 
Disadvantages of Hacking 
Hacking is quite dangerous if it is done with harmful intent. It can cause: 
 
Massive security breach. 
 
Unauthorized system access on private information. 
 
Privacy violation. 
 
Hampering system operation. 
 
Denial of service attacks 
 
Malicious attack on the system. 
Purpose of Hacking 
There could be various positive and negative intentions behind performing hacking 
activities. Here is a list of some probable reasons why people indulge in hacking activities:  
 
Just for fun 
 
Show-off 
 
Steal important information 
 
Damaging the system 
 
Hampering privacy 
 
Money extortion 
 
System security testing 
 
To break policy compliance 
Ethical Hacking

Hackers can be classified into different categories such as white hat, black hat, and grey 
hat, based on their intent of hacking a system. These different terms come from old 
Spaghetti Westerns, where the bad guy wears a black cowboy hat and the good guy wears 
a white hat. 
White Hat Hackers 
White Hat hackers are also known as Ethical Hackers. They never intent to harm a 
system, rather they try to find out weaknesses in a computer or a network system as a 
part of penetration testing and vulnerability assessments. 
Ethical hacking is not illegal and it is one of the demanding jobs available in the IT industry. 
There are numerous companies that hire ethical hackers for penetration testing and 
vulnerability assessments. 
Black Hat Hackers 
Black Hat hackers, also known as crackers, are those who hack in order to gain 
unauthorized access to a system and harm its operations or steal sensitive information.  
Black Hat hacking is always illegal because of its bad intent which includes stealing 
corporate data, violating privacy, damaging the system, blocking network communication, 
etc. 
Grey Hat Hackers 
Grey hat hackers are a blend of both black hat and white hat hackers. They act without 
malicious intent but for their fun, they exploit a security weakness in a computer system 
or network without the owner’s permission or knowledge.  
Their intent is to bring the weakness to the attention of the owners and getting 
appreciation or a little bounty from the owners. 
Miscellaneous Hackers 
Apart from the above well-known classes of hackers, we have the following categories of 
hackers based on what they hack and how they do it: 
Red Hat Hackers 
Red hat hackers are again a blend of both black hat and white hat hackers. They are 
usually on the level of hacking government agencies, top-secret information hubs, and 
generally anything that falls under the category of sensitive information. 
 
 
2. Ethical Hacking − Hacker Types 
Ethical Hacking

Blue Hat Hackers 
A blue hat hacker is someone outside computer security consulting firms who is used to 
bug-test a system prior to its launch. They look for loopholes that can be exploited and 
try to close these gaps. Microsoft also uses the term BlueHat to represent a series of 
security briefing events. 
Elite Hackers 
This is a social status among hackers, which is used to describe the most skilled. Newly 
discovered exploits will circulate among these hackers. 
Script Kiddie 
A script kiddie is a non-expert who breaks into computer systems by using pre-packaged 
automated tools written by others, usually with little understanding of the underlying 
concept, hence the term Kiddie. 
Neophyte 
A neophyte, "n00b", or "newbie" or "Green Hat Hacker" is someone who is new to hacking 
or phreaking and has almost no knowledge or experience of the workings of technology 
and hacking. 
Hacktivist 
A hacktivist is a hacker who utilizes technology to announce a social, ideological, religious, 
or political message. In general, most hacktivism involves website defacement or denial-
of-service attacks.

In this chapter, we will have a brief synopsis of some of the famous Hackers and how they 
became famous.  
 
Jonathan James 
Jonathan James was an American hacker, ill-
famous as the first juvenile sent to prison for 
cybercrime in United States. He committed 
suicide in 2008 of a self-inflicted gunshot 
wound.  
In 1999, at the age of 16, he gained access to 
several computers by breaking the password of 
a server that belonged to NASA and stole the 
source code of the International Space Station 
among other sensitive information. 
 
Ian Murphy 
Ian Murphy, also known as Captain Zap, at one 
point of time was having high school students 
steal computer equipment for him. Ian self-
proclaims to have been "the first hacker ever 
convicted of a crime".  
Ian's career as a master hacker was fabricated 
in 1986 after he and his unemployed wife 
decided to form some type of business.  
He has a long history of computer and Internet 
frauds. One of his favourite games is to forge 
Email headers and to send out third-party 
threat letters.

Linus Torvalds is known as one of the best 
hackers of all time. He rose to fame by creating 
Linux, the very popular Unix-based operating 
system. Linux is open source and thousands of 
developers have contributed to its Kernel. 
However, 
Torvalds 
remains 
the 
ultimate 
authority on what new code is incorporated into 
the standard Linux kernel. As of 2006, 
approximately two percent of the Linux kernel 
was written by Torvalds himself. 
He just aspires to be simple and have fun by 
making the world’s best operating system. 
Torvalds has received honorary doctorates 
from Stockholm University and University of 
Helsinki. 
Robert Morris 
Robert Morris, known as the creator of the 
Morris Worm, the first computer worm to be 
unleashed on the Internet. The worm had the 
capability to slow down computers and make 
them no longer usable. As a result of this, he 
was sentenced to three years’ probation, 400 
hours of community service and also had to 
pay a penalty amount of $10,500.  
Morris is currently working as a tenured 
professor at the MIT Computer Science and 
Artificial Intelligence Laboratory.

administrator and hacker. He was famously 
accused of the “biggest military computer hack 
of all time”. He had successfully hacked the 
networks of Army, Air Force, Navy and NASA 
systems of the United States government.  
In his statements to the media, he has often 
mentioned that his motivation was only to find 
evidence of UFOs, antigravity technology, and 
the suppression of “free energy” that could 
potentially be useful to the public. 
 
 
Kevin Poulsen 
Kevin Poulsen, also known as Dark Dante, 
became famous for his notoriety when he took 
over 
all 
the 
telephone 
lines 
of 
Los 
Angeles radio station KIIS-FM, 
guaranteeing 
that he would be the 102nd caller and win the 
prize of a Porsche 944 S2.  
Poulsen also drew the ire of FBI, when he 
hacked into federal computers for wiretap 
information, for which he had to serve a 
sentence of five years. He has reinvented 
himself as a journalist and has carved a niche 
for himself in this field.

In this chapter, we will discuss in brief some of famous tools that are widely used to 
prevent hacking and getting unauthorized access to a computer or network system.  
NMAP 
Nmap stands for Network Mapper. It is an open source tool that is used widely for network 
discovery and security auditing. Nmap was originally designed to scan large networks, but 
it can work equally well for single hosts. Network administrators also find it useful for tasks 
such as network inventory, managing service upgrade schedules, and monitoring host or 
service uptime.  
Nmap uses raw IP packets to determine: 
 
what hosts are available on the network,  
 
what services those hosts are offering,  
 
what operating systems they are running on,  
 
what type of firewalls are in use, and other such characteristics.  
Nmap runs on all major computer operating systems such as Windows, Mac OS X, and 
Linux.  
Metasploit 
Metasploit is one of the most powerful exploit tools. It’s a product of Rapid7 and most of 
its resources can be found at: www.metasploit.com. It comes in two versions − 
commercial and free edition. Matasploit can be used with command prompt or with Web 
UI. 
With Metasploit, you can perform the following operations: 
 
Conduct basic penetration tests on small networks 
 
Run spot checks on the exploitability of vulnerabilities 
 
Discover the network or import scan data 
 
Browse exploit modules and run individual exploits on hosts 
Burp Suite 
Burp Suite is a popular platform that is widely used for performing security testing of web 
applications. It has various tools that work in collaboration to support the entire testing 
process, from initial mapping and analysis of an application's attack surface, through to 
finding and exploiting security vulnerabilities. 
Burp is easy to use and provides the administrators full control to combine advanced 
manual techniques with automation for efficient testing. Burp can be easily configured and 
it contains features to assist even the most experienced testers with their work. 
5. Ethical Hacking − Tools

Angry IP Scanner 
Angry IP scanner is a lightweight, cross-platform IP address and port scanner. It can scan 
IP addresses in any range. It can be freely copied and used anywhere. In order to increase 
the scanning speed, it uses multithreaded approach, wherein a separate scanning thread 
is created for each scanned IP address. 
Angry IP Scanner simply pings each IP address to check if it’s alive, and then, it resolves 
its hostname, determines the MAC address, scans ports, etc. The amount of gathered data 
about each host can be saved to TXT, XML, CSV, or IP-Port list files. With help of plugins, 
Angry IP Scanner can gather any information about scanned IPs.  
Cain & Abel 
Cain & Abel is a password recovery tool for Microsoft Operating Systems. It helps in easy 
recovery of various kinds of passwords by employing any of the following methods: 
 
sniffing the network,  
 
 
cracking encrypted passwords using Dictionary, Brute-Force and Cryptanalysis 
attacks, 
 
 
recording VoIP conversations,  
 
 
decoding scrambled passwords,  
 
 
recovering wireless network keys,  
 
 
revealing password boxes,  
 
 
uncovering cached passwords and analyzing routing protocols.  
Cain & Abel is a useful tool for security consultants, professional penetration testers and 
everyone else who plans to use it for ethical reasons.  
Ettercap 
Ettercap stands for Ethernet Capture. It is a network security tool for Man-in-the-Middle 
attacks. It features sniffing of live connections, content filtering on the fly and many other 
interesting tricks. Ettercap has inbuilt features for network and host analysis. It supports 
active and passive dissection of many protocols.  
You can run Ettercap on all the popular operating systems such as Windows, Linux, and

Network Stumbler 
Network stumbler is a WiFi scanner and monitoring tool for Windows. It allows network 
professionals to detect WLANs. It is widely used by networking enthusiasts and hackers 
because it helps you find non-broadcasting wireless networks. 
Network Stumbler can be used to verify if a network is well configured, its signal strength 
or coverage, and detect interference between one or more wireless networks. It can also 
be used to non-authorized connections. 
ToneLoc 
ToneLoc stands for Tone Locator. It was a popular war dialling computer program written 
for MS-DOS in the early 90’s. War dialling is a technique of using a modem to automatically 
scan a list of telephone numbers, usually dialling every number in a local area code.  
Malicious hackers use the resulting lists in breaching computer security - for guessing user 
accounts, or locating modems that might provide an entry-point into computer or other 
electronic systems. 
It can be used by security personnel to detect unauthorized devices on a company’s 
telephone network.

Final Note 
You need to stay as a White Hat Hacker which means you need to work within given 
boundaries. Never intrude or attack any computer or network without a required 
permission from the authorities. 
As a final note, it is highly recommended that you refrain from engaging yourself in black 
hat hacking which may spoil your entire career.  
Ethical Hacking

Like all good projects, ethical hacking too has a set of distinct phases. It helps hackers to 
make a structured ethical hacking attack. 
Different security training manuals explain the process of ethical hacking in different ways, 
but for me as a Certified Ethical Hacker, the entire process can be categorized into the 
following six phases. 
 
Ethical Hacking Process 
Reconnaissance 
Reconnaissance is the phase where the attacker gathers information about a target using 
active or passive means. The tools that are widely used in this process are NMAP, Hping, 
Maltego, and Google Dorks. 
 
7. Ethical Hacking − Process 
Ethical Hacking 
19 
 
Scanning 
In this process, the attacker begins to actively probe a target machine or network for 
vulnerabilities that can be exploited. The tools used in this process are Nessus, Nexpose, 
and NMAP. 
Gaining Access 
In this process, the vulnerability is located and you attempt to exploit it in order to enter 
into the system. The primary tool that is used in this process is Metasploit. 
Maintaining Access 
It is the process where the hacker has already gained access into a system. After gaining 
access, the hacker installs some backdoors in order to enter into the system when he 
needs access in this owned system in future. Metasploit is the preferred tool in this process.  
Clearing Tracks 
This process is actually an unethical activity. It has to do with the deletion of logs of all 
the activities that take place during the hacking process. 
Reporting 
Reporting is the last step of finishing the ethical hacking process. Here the Ethical Hacker 
compiles a report with his findings and the job that was done such as the tools used, the 
success rate, vulnerabilities found, and the exploit processes. 
Quick Tip 
The processes are not standard. You can adopt a set of different processes and tools 
according to your techniques that you are comfortable with. The process is of least 
significance as long as you are able to get the desired results. 
 
Ethical Hacking 
20 
 
Information Gathering and getting to know the target systems is the first process in ethical 
hacking. Reconnaissance is a set of processes and techniques (Footprinting, Scanning & 
Enumeration) used to covertly discover and collect information about a target system.  
During reconnaissance, an ethical hacker attempts to gather as much information about a 
target system as possible, following the seven steps listed below: 
 
Gather initial information 
 
Determine the network range 
 
Identify active machines 
 
Discover open ports and access points 
 
Fingerprint the operating system 
 
Uncover services on ports 
 
Map the network 
We will discuss in detail all these steps in the subsequent chapters of this tutorial. 
Reconnaissance takes place in two parts: Active Reconnaissance and Passive 
Reconnaissance. 
Active Reconnaissance 
In this process, you will directly interact with the computer system to gain information. 
This information can be relevant and accurate. But there is a risk of getting detected if 
you are planning active reconnaissance without permission. If you are detected, then 
system admin can take severe action against you and trail your subsequent activities. 
Passive Reconnaissance 
In this process, you will not be directly connected to a computer system. This process is 
used to gather essential information without ever interacting with the target systems. 
 
8. Ethical Hacking − Reconnaissance 
Ethical Hacking 
21 
 
Footprinting is a part of reconnaissance process which is used for gathering possible 
information about a target computer system or network. Footprinting could be both 
passive and active. Reviewing a company’s website is an example of passive footprinting, 
whereas attempting to gain access to sensitive information through social engineering is 
an example of active information gathering. 
Footprinting is basically the first step where hacker gathers as much information as 
possible to find ways to intrude into a target system or at least decide what type of attacks 
will be more suitable for the target.  
During this phase, a hacker can collect the following information: 
 
Domain name 
 
IP Addresses 
 
Namespaces 
 
Employee information 
 
Phone numbers 
 
E-mails 
 
Job Information 
In the following section, we will discuss how to extract the basic and easily accessible 
information about any computer system or network that is linked to the Internet. 
Domain Name Information 
You can use http://www.whois.com/whois website to get detailed information about 
a domain name information including its owner, its registrar, date of registration, expiry, 
name server, owner's contact information, etc. 
 
 
 
9. Ethical Hacking − Footprinting 
Ethical Hacking 
22 
 
Here is a sample record of www.tutorialspoint.com extracted from WHOIS Lookup: 
 
Quick Fix 
It's always recommended to keep your domain name profile a private one which should 
hide the above-mentioned information from potential hackers.  
Ethical Hacking 
23 
 
Finding IP Address 
You can use ping command at your prompt. This command is available on Windows as 
well as on Linux OS. Following is the example to find out the IP address of 
tutorialspoint.com 
$ping tutorialspoint.com 
It will produce the following result: 
PING tutorialspoint.com (66.135.33.172) 56(84) bytes of data. 
64 bytes from 66.135.33.172: icmp_seq=1 ttl=64 time=0.028 ms 
64 bytes from 66.135.33.172: icmp_seq=2 ttl=64 time=0.021 ms 
64 bytes from 66.135.33.172: icmp_seq=3 ttl=64 time=0.021 ms 
64 bytes from 66.135.33.172: icmp_seq=4 ttl=64 time=0.021 ms 
Finding Hosting Company 
Once you have the website address, you can get further detail by using 
ip2location.com website. Following is the example to find out the details of an IP 
address: 
 
Here the ISP row gives you the detail about the hosting company because IP addresses 
are usually provided by hosting companies only. 
 
Ethical Hacking 
24 
 
Quick Fix 
If a computer system or network is linked with the Internet directly, then you cannot hide 
the IP address and the related information such as the hosting company, its location, ISP, 
etc. If you have a server containing very sensitive data, then it is recommended to keep 
it behind a secure proxy so that hackers cannot get the exact details of your actual server. 
This way, it will be difficult for any potential hacker to reach your server directly. 
Another effective way of hiding your system IP and ultimately all the associated 
information is to go through a Virtual Private Network (VPN). If you configure a VPN, then 
the whole traffic routes through the VPN network, so your true IP address assigned by 
your ISP is always hidden.  
IP Address Ranges 
Small sites may have a single IP address associated with them, but larger websites usually 
have multiple IP addresses serving different domains and sub-domains. 
You can obtain a range of IP addresses assigned to a particular company using American 
Registry for Internet Numbers (ARIN). 
 
You can enter company name in the highlighted search box to find out a list of all the 
assigned IP addresses to that company. 
History of the Website 
It is very easy to get a complete history of any website using www.archive.org. 
 
You can enter a domain name in the search box to find out how the website was looking 
at a given point of time and what were the pages available on the website on different 
dates. 
Ethical Hacking 
25 
 
 
Quick Fix 
Though there are some advantages of keeping your website in an archive database, but if 
you do not like anybody to see how your website progressed through different stages, 
then you can request archive.org to delete the history of your website. 
Ethical Hacking 
26 
 
The term OS fingerprinting in Ethical Hacking refers to any method used to determine 
what operating system is running on a remote computer. This could be: 
 
Active Fingerprinting – Active fingerprinting is accomplished by sending specially 
crafted packets to a target machine and then noting down its response and 
analyzing the gathered information to determine the target OS. In the following 
section, we have given an example to explain how you can use NMAP tool to detect 
the OS of a target domain. 
 
 
Passive Fingerprinting − Passive fingerprinting is based on sniffer traces from 
the remote system. Based on the sniffer traces (such as Wireshark) of the packets, 
you can determine the operating system of the remote host. 
We have the following four important elements that we will look at to determine the 
operating system: 
 
TTL − What the operating system sets the Time-To-Live on the outbound packet. 
 
Window Size − What the operating system sets the Window Size at. 
 
DF − Does the operating system set the Don't Fragment bit. 
 
TOS − Does the operating system set the Type of Service, and if so, at what. 
By analyzing these factors of a packet, you may be able to determine the remote operating 
system. This system is not 100% accurate, and works better for some operating systems 
than others. 
Basic Steps 
Before attacking a system, it is required that you know what operating system is hosting 
a website. Once a target OS is known, then it becomes easy to determine which 
vulnerabilities might be present to exploit the target system. 
Below is a simple nmap command which can be used to identify the operating system 
serving a website and all the opened ports associated with the domain name, i.e., the 
IP address. 
$nmap -O -v tutorialspoint.com 
It will show you the following sensitive information about the given domain name or IP 
address:

If you do not have nmap command installed on your Linux system, then you can install it 
using the following yum command: 
$yum install nmap 
Ethical Hacking 
28 
 
You can go through nmap command in detail to check and understand the different 
features associated with a system and secure it against malicious attacks. 
Quick Fix 
You can hide your main system behind a secure proxy server or a VPN so that your 
complete identity is safe and ultimately your main system remains safe.  
Port Scanning 
We have just seen information given by nmap command. This command lists down all the 
open ports on a given server. 
PORT     STATE SERVICE 
22/tcp   open  ssh 
80/tcp   open  http 
443/tcp  open  https 
3306/tcp open  mysql 
You can also check if a particular port is opened or not using the following command: 
$nmap -sT -p 443 tutorialspoint.com 
It will produce the following result:  
Starting Nmap 5.51 ( http://nmap.org ) at 2015-10-04 10:19 CDT

Nmap done: 1 IP address (1 host up) scanned in 0.04 seconds 
Once a hacker knows about open ports, then he can plan different attack techniques 
through the open ports. 
Quick Fix 
It is always recommended to check and close all the unwanted ports to safeguard the 
system from malicious attacks. 
 
Ethical Hacking 
29 
 
Ping Sweep 
A ping sweep is a network scanning technique that you can use to determine which IP 
address from a range of IP addresses map to live hosts. Ping Sweep is also known as 
ICMP sweep. 
You can use fping command for ping sweep. This command is a ping-like program which 
uses the Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP) echo request to determine if a host is 
up.  
fping is different from ping in that you can specify any number of hosts on the command 
line, or specify a file containing the lists of hosts to ping. If a host does not respond within 
a certain time limit and/or retry limit, it will be considered unreachable. 
Quick Fix 
To disable ping sweeps on a network, you can block ICMP ECHO requests from outside 
sources. This can be done using the following command which will create a firewall rule 
in iptable. 
$iptables -A OUTPUT -p icmp --icmp-type echo-request -j DROP 
DNS Enumeration 
Domain Name Server (DNS) is like a map or an address book. In fact, it is like a distributed 
database which is used to translate an IP address 192.111.1.120 to a name 
www.example.com and vice versa. 
DNS enumeration is the process of locating all the DNS servers and their corresponding 
records for an organization. The idea is to gather as much interesting details as possible 
about your target before initiating an attack. 
You can use nslookup command available on Linux to get DNS and host-related 
information. In addition, you can use the following DNSenum script to get detailed 
information about a domain: 
DNSenum.pl 
DNSenum script can perform the following important operations: 
 
Get the host's addresses 
 
 
Get the nameservers 
 
 
Get the MX record 
 
 
Perform axfr queries on nameservers 
 
 
Get extra names and subdomains via Google scraping 
 
 
Brute force subdomains from file can also perform recursion on a subdomain having 
NS records 
Ethical Hacking 
30 
 
 
 
Calculate C class domain network ranges and perform whois queries on them 
 
 
Perform reverse lookups on netranges 
Quick Fix 
DNS Enumeration does not have a quick fix and it is really beyond the scope of this tutorial. 
Preventing DNS Enumeration is a big challenge.  
If your DNS is not configured in a secure way, it is possible that lots of sensitive information 
about the network and organization can go outside and an untrusted Internet user can 
perform a DNS zone transfer. 
 
Ethical Hacking 
31 
 
Sniffing is the process of monitoring and capturing all the packets passing through a given 
network using sniffing tools. It is a form of “tapping phone wires” and get to know about 
the conversation. It is also called wiretapping applied to the computer networks.  
There is so much possibility that if a set of enterprise switch ports is open, then one of 
their employees can sniff the whole traffic of the network. Anyone in the same physical 
location can plug into the network using Ethernet cable or connect wirelessly to that 
network and sniff the total traffic.  
In other words, Sniffing allows you to see all sorts of traffic, both protected and 
unprotected. In the right conditions and with the right protocols in place, an attacking 
party may be able to gather information that can be used for further attacks or to cause 
other issues for the network or system owner. 
What can be sniffed?  
One can sniff the following sensitive information from a network:  
 
Email traffic  
 
FTP passwords 
 
Web traffics 
 
Telnet passwords 
 
Router configuration 
 
Chat sessions 
 
DNS traffic 
How it works 
A sniffer normally turns the NIC of the system to the promiscuous mode so that it listens 
to all the data transmitted on its segment. 
Promiscuous mode refers to the unique way of Ethernet hardware, in particular, network 
interface cards (NICs), that allows an NIC to receive all traffic on the network, even if it is 
not addressed to this NIC. By default, a NIC ignores all traffic that is not addressed to it, 
which is done by comparing the destination address of the Ethernet packet with the 
hardware address (a.k.a. MAC) of the device. While this makes perfect sense for 
networking, non-promiscuous mode makes it difficult to use network monitoring and 
analysis software for diagnosing connectivity issues or traffic accounting. 
 
11.  Ethical Hacking − Sniffing 
Ethical Hacking 
32 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Sniffing the networks 
 
A sniffer can continuously monitor all the traffic to a computer through the NIC by decoding 
the information encapsulated in the data packets. 
Types of Sniffing 
Sniffing can be either Active or Passive in nature. 
Passive Sniffing  
In passive sniffing, the traffic is locked but it is not altered in any way. Passive sniffing 
allows listening only. It works with Hub devices. On a hub device, the traffic is sent to all 
the ports. In a network that uses hubs to connect systems, all hosts on the network can 
see the traffic. Therefore, an attacker can easily capture traffic going through.  
The good news is that hubs are almost obsolete nowadays. Most modern networks use 
switches. Hence, passive sniffing is no more effective.  
Active Sniffing  
In active sniffing, the traffic is not only locked and monitored, but it may also be altered 
in some way as determined by the attack. Active sniffing is used to sniff a switch-based 
network. It involves injecting address resolution packets (ARP) into a target network 
to flood on the switch content addressable memory (CAM) table. CAM keeps track of 
which host is connected to which port. 
Following are the Active Sniffing Techniques: 
 
MAC Flooding 
 
DHCP Attacks 
 
DNS Poisoning 
 
Spoofing Attacks 


Protocols which are affected 
Protocols such as the tried and true TCP/IP were never designed with security in mind and 
therefore do not offer much resistance to potential intruders. Several rules lend 
themselves to easy sniffing: 
 
HTTP: It is used to send information in the clear text without any encryption and 
thus a real target. 
 
 
SMTP (Simple Mail Transfer Protocol): SMTP is basically utilized in the transfer of 
emails. This protocol is efficient, but it does not include any protection against 
sniffing. 
 
 
NNTP (Network News Transfer Protocol): It is used for all types of communications, 
but its main drawback is that data and even passwords are sent over the network 
as clear text. 
 
 
POP (Post Office Protocol): POP is strictly used to receive emails from the servers. 
This protocol does not include protection against sniffing because it can be trapped. 
 
 
FTP (File Transfer Protocol): FTP is used to send and receive files, but it does not 
offer any security features. All the data is sent as clear text that can be easily 
sniffed.  
 
 
IMAP (Internet Message Access Protocol): IMAP is same as SMTP in its functions, 
but it is highly vulnerable to sniffing.  
 
 
Telnet: Telnet sends everything (usernames, passwords, keystrokes) over the 
network as clear text and hence, it can be easily sniffed.  
Sniffers are not the dumb utilities that allow you to view only live traffic. If you really want 
to analyze each packet, save the capture and review it whenever time allows.  
Hardware Protocol Analyzers 
Before we go into further details of sniffers, it is important that we discuss about 
hardware protocol analyzers. These devices plug into the network at the hardware 
level and can monitor traffic without manipulating it.  
 
Hardware protocol analyzers are used to monitor and identify malicious network 
traffic generated by hacking software installed in the system.  
 
 
They capture a data packet, decode it, and analyze its content according to certain 
rules.  
 
 
Hardware protocol analyzers allow attackers to see individual data bytes of each 
packet passing through the cable. 
These hardware devices are not readily available to most ethical hackers due to their 
enormous cost in many cases.

Lawful Interception 
Lawful Interception (LI) is defined as legally sanctioned access to communications network 
data such as telephone calls or email messages. LI must always be in pursuance of a lawful 
authority for the purpose of analysis or evidence. Therefore, LI is a security process in 
which a network operator or service provider gives law enforcement officials permission 
to access private communications of individuals or organizations.  
Almost all countries have drafted and enacted legislation to regulate lawful interception 
procedures; standardization groups are creating LI technology specifications. Usually, LI 
activities are taken for the purpose of infrastructure protection and cyber security. 
However, operators of private network infrastructures can maintain LI capabilities within 
their own networks as an inherent right, unless otherwise prohibited.  
LI was formerly known as wiretapping and has existed since the inception of electronic 
communications.

There are so many tools available to perform sniffing over a network, and they all have 
their own features to help a hacker analyze traffic and dissect the information. Sniffing 
tools are extremely common applications. We have listed here some of the interesting 
ones: 
 
BetterCAP: BetterCAP is a powerful, flexible and portable tool created to perform 
various types of MITM attacks against a network, manipulate HTTP, HTTPS and TCP 
traffic in real-time, sniff for credentials, and much more. 
 
 
Ettercap: Ettercap is a comprehensive suite for man-in-the-middle attacks. It 
features sniffing of live connections, content filtering on the fly and many other 
interesting tricks. It supports active and passive dissection of many protocols and 
includes many features for network and host analysis. 
 
 
Wireshark: It is one of the most widely known and used packet sniffers. It offers 
a tremendous number of features designed to assist in the dissection and analysis 
of traffic.  
 
 
Tcpdump: It is a well-known command-line packet analyzer. It provides the ability 
to intercept and observe TCP/IP and other packets during transmission over the 
network. Available at www.tcpdump.org. 
 
 
WinDump: A Windows port of the popular Linux packet sniffer tcpdump, which is 
a command-line tool that is perfect for displaying header information. 
 
 
OmniPeek: Manufactured by WildPackets, OmniPeek is a commercial product that 
is the evolution of the product EtherPeek. 
 
 
Dsniff: A suite of tools designed to perform sniffing with different protocols with 
the intent of intercepting and revealing passwords. Dsniff is designed for Unix and 
Linux platforms and does not have a full equivalent on the Windows platform. 
 
 
EtherApe: It is a Linux/Unix tool designed to display graphically a system's 
incoming and outgoing connections. 
 
 
MSN Sniffer: It is a sniffing utility specifically designed for sniffing traffic generated 
by the MSN Messenger application. 
 
 
NetWitness NextGen: It includes a hardware-based sniffer, along with other 
features, designed to monitor and analyze all traffic on a network. This tool is used 
by the FBI and other law enforcement agencies. 
A potential hacker can use any of these sniffing tools to analyze traffic on a network and 
dissect information.

Address Resolution Protocol (ARP) is a stateless protocol used for resolving IP addresses 
to machine MAC addresses. All network devices that need to communicate on the network 
broadcast ARP queries in the system to find out other machines’ MAC addresses. ARP 
Poisoning is also known as ARP Spoofing. 
Here is how ARP works: 
 
When one machine needs to communicate with another, it looks up its ARP table.  
 
 
If the MAC address is not found in the table, the ARP_request is broadcasted over 
the network.  
 
 
All machines on the network will compare this IP address to MAC address.  
 
 
If one of the machines in the network identifies this address, then it will respond 
to the ARP_request with its IP and MAC address.  
 
 
The requesting computer will store the address pair in its ARP table and 
communication will take place. 
What is ARP Spoofing? 
ARP packets can be forged to send data to the attacker’s machine.  
 
ARP spoofing constructs a large number of forged ARP request and reply packets 
to overload the switch.  
 
 
The switch is set in forwarding mode and after the ARP table is flooded with 
spoofed ARP responses, the attackers can sniff all network packets.  
Attackers flood a target computer ARP cache with forged entries, which is also known as 
poisoning. ARP poisoning uses Man-in-the-Middle access to poison the network. 
What is MITM? 
The Man-in-the-Middle attack (abbreviated MITM, MitM, MIM, MiM, MITMA) implies an 
active attack where the adversary impersonates the user by creating a connection between 
the victims and sends messages between them. In this case, the victims think that they 
are communicating with each other, but in reality, the malicious actor controls the 
communication.  
13.  Ethical Hacking − ARP Poisoning  
Ethical Hacking 
37 
 
 
A third person exists to control and monitor the traffic of communication between two 
parties. Some protocols such as SSL serve to prevent this type of attack. 
ARP Poisoning − Exercise 
In this exercise, we have used BetterCAP to perform ARP poisoning in LAN environment 
using VMware workstation in which we have installed Kali Linux and Ettercap tool to 
sniff the local traffic in LAN.  
For this exercise, you would need the following tools: 
 
VMware workstation 
 
Kali Linux or Linux Operating system 
 
Ettercap Tool 
 
LAN connection 
Note: This attack is possible in wired and wireless networks. You can perform this attack 
in local LAN. 
Step 1: Install the VMware workstation and install the Kali Linux operating system.  
Step 2: Login into the Kali Linux using username pass “root, toor”. 
Step 3: Make sure you are connected to local LAN and check the IP address by typing the 
command ifconfig in the terminal. 
Ethical Hacking 
38 
 
 
Step 4: Open up the terminal and type “Ettercap –G” to start the graphical version of 
Ettercap. 
 
Step 5: Now click the tab “sniff” in the menu bar and select “unified sniffing” and click OK 
to select the interface. We are going to use “eth0” which means Ethernet connection. 
 
Step 6: Now click the “hosts” tab in the menu bar and click “scan for hosts”. It will start 
scanning the whole network for the alive hosts. 
Ethical Hacking 
39 
 
Step 7: Next, click the “hosts” tab and select “hosts list” to see the number of hosts 
available in the network. This list also includes the default gateway address. We have to 
be careful when we select the targets. 
 
Step 8: Now we have to choose the targets. In MITM, our target is the host machine, and 
the route will be the router address to forward the traffic. In an MITM attack, the attacker 
intercepts the network and sniffs the packets. So, we will add the victim as “target 1” and 
the router address as “target 2.”  
In VMware environment, the default gateway will always end with “2” because “1” is 
assigned to the physical machine. 
Step 9: In this scenario, our target is “192.168.121.129” and the router is 
“192.168.121.2”. So we will add target 1 as victim IP and target 2 as router IP. 
 
Step 10: Now click on “MITM” and click “ARP poisoning”. Thereafter, check the option 
“Sniff remote connections” and click OK. 
 
Ethical Hacking 
40 
 
Step 11: Click “start” and select “start sniffing”. This will start ARP poisoning in the 
network which means we have enabled our network card in “promiscuous mode” and now 
the local traffic can be sniffed. 
Note: We have allowed only HTTP sniffing with Ettercap, so don’t expect HTTPS packets 
to be sniffed with this process.  
Step 12: Now it’s time to see the results; if our victim logged into some websites. You 
can see the results in the toolbar of Ettercap. 
 
This is how sniffing works. You must have understood how easy it is to get the HTTP 
credentials just by enabling ARP poisoning.  
ARP Poisoning has the potential to cause huge losses in company environments. This is 
the place where ethical hackers are appointed to secure the networks.  
Like ARP poisoning, there are other attacks such as MAC flooding, MAC spoofing, DNS 
poisoning, ICMP poisoning, etc. that can cause significant loss to a network. 
In the next chapter, we will discuss another type of attack known as DNS poisoning. 
Ethical Hacking 
41 
 
DNS Poisoning is a technique that tricks a DNS server into believing that it has received 
authentic information when, in reality, it has not. It results in the substitution of false IP 
address at the DNS level where web addresses are converted into numeric IP addresses. 
It allows an attacker to replace IP address entries for a target site on a given DNS server 
with IP address of the server controls. An attacker can create fake DNS entries for the 
server which may contain malicious content with the same name. 
For instance, a user types www.google.com, but the user is sent to another fraud site 
instead of being directed to Google’s servers. As we understand, DNS poisoning is used to 
redirect the users to fake pages which are managed by the attackers. 
DNS Poisoning − Exercise 
Let’s do an exercise on DNS poisoning using the same tool, Ettercap. 
DNS Poisoning is quite similar to ARP Poisoning. To initiate DNS poisoning, you have to 
start with ARP poisoning, which we have already discussed in the previous chapter. We 
will use DNS spoof plugin which is already there in Ettercap. 
Step 1: Open up the terminal and type “nano etter.dns”. This file contains all entries for 
DNS addresses which is used by Ettercap to resolve the domain name addresses. In this 
file, we will add a fake entry of “Facebook”. If someone wants to open Facebook, he will 
be redirected to another website. 
 
Step 2: Now insert the entries under the words “Redirect it to www.linux.org”. See the 
following example: 
 
Step 3: Now save this file and exit by saving the file. Use “ctrl+x” to save the file. 
Step 4: After this, the whole process is same to start ARP poisoning. After starting ARP 
poisoning, click on “plugins” in the menu bar and select “dns_spoof” plugin. 
14.  Ethical Hacking − DNS Poisoning 
Ethical Hacking 
42 
 
 
Step 5: After activating the DNS_spoof, you will see in the results that facebook.com will 
start spoofed to Google IP whenever someone types it in his browser. 
 
It means the user gets the Google page instead of facebook.com on their browser.  
In this exercise, we saw how network traffic can be sniffed through different tools and 
methods. Here a company needs an ethical hacker to provide network security to stop all 
these attacks. Let’s see what an ethical hacker can do to prevent DNS Poisoning.   
Defenses against DNS Poisoning  
As an ethical hacker, your work could very likely put you in a position of prevention rather 
than pen testing. What you know as an attacker can help you prevent the very techniques 
you employ from the outside.  
Here are defenses against the attacks we just covered from a pen tester’s perspective: 
 
Use a hardware-switched network for the most sensitive portions of your network 
in an effort to isolate traffic to a single segment or collision domain. 
 
 
Implement IP DHCP Snooping on switches to prevent ARP poisoning and spoofing 
attacks. 
 
 
Implement policies to prevent promiscuous mode on network adapters. 
 
 
Be careful when deploying wireless access points, knowing that all traffic on the 
wireless network is subject to sniffing. 
 
 
Encrypt your sensitive traffic using an encrypting protocol such as SSH or IPsec. 
 
Ethical Hacking 
43 
 
 
Port security is used by switches that have the ability to be programmed to allow 
only specific MAC addresses to send and receive data on each port. 
 
 
IPv6 has security benefits and options that IPv4 does not have. 
 
 
Replacing protocols such as FTP and Telnet with SSH is an effective defense against 
sniffing. If SSH is not a viable solution, consider protecting older legacy protocols 
with IPsec. 
 
 
Virtual Private Networks (VPNs) can provide an effective defense against sniffing 
due to their encryption aspect. 
 
 
SSL is a great defense along with IPsec. 
Summary 
In this chapter, we discussed how attackers can capture and analyze all the traffic by 
placing a packet sniffer in a network. With a real-time example, we saw how easy it is to 
get the credentials of a victim from a given network. Attackers use MAC attacks, ARP and 
DNS poisoning attacks to sniff the network traffic and get hold of sensitive information 
such as email conversations and passwords.

Exploitation is a piece of programmed software or script which can allow hackers to take 
control over a system, exploiting its vulnerabilities. Hackers normally use vulnerability 
scanners like Nessus, Nexpose, OpenVAS, etc. to find these vulnerabilities.  
Metasploit is a powerful tool to locate vulnerabilities in a system. 
 
Based on the vulnerabilities, we find exploits. Here, we will discuss some of the best 
vulnerability search engines that you can use. 
Exploit Database 
www.exploit-db.com is the place where you can find all the exploits related to a 
vulnerability.

Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures 
Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) is the standard for information security 
vulnerability names. CVE is a dictionary of publicly known information security 
vulnerabilities and exposures. It’s free for public use. https://cve.mitre.org  
 
National Vulnerability Database 
National Vulnerability Database (NVD) is the U.S. government repository of standards 
based vulnerability management data. This data enables automation of vulnerability 
management, security measurement, and compliance. You can locate this database at: 
https://nvd.nist.gov 
NVD includes databases of security checklists, security-related software flaws, 
misconfigurations, product names, and impact metrics.

In general, you will see that there are two types of exploits: 
 
Remote Exploits − These are the type of exploits where you don’t have access to 
a remote system or network. Hackers use remote exploits to gain access to systems 
that are located at remote places.  
 
 
Local Exploits – Local exploits are generally used by a system user having access 
to a local system, but who wants to overpass his rights.  
Quick Fix 
Vulnerabilities generally arise due to missing updates, so it is recommended that you 
update your system on a regular basis, for example, once a week.  
In Windows environment, you can activate automatic updates by using the options 
available in the Control Panel  System and Security  Windows Updates.  
 
In Linux Centos, you can use the following command to install automatic update package. 
yum -y install yum-cron

Enumeration belongs to the first phase of Ethical Hacking, i.e., “Information Gathering”. 
This is a process where the attacker establishes an active connection with the victim and 
try to discover as much attack vectors as possible, which can be used to exploit the 
systems further. 
Enumeration can be used to gain information on:  
 
Network shares  
 
SNMP data, if they are not secured properly 
 
IP tables 
 
Usernames of different systems 
 
Passwords policies lists 
Enumerations depend on the services that the systems offer. They can be: 
 
DNS enumeration 
 
NTP enumeration 
 
SNMP enumeration 
 
Linux/Windows enumeration 
 
SMB enumeration 
Let us now discuss some of the tools that are widely used for Enumeration.  
NTP Suite 
NTP Suite is used for NTP enumeration. This is important because in a network 
environment, you can find other primary servers that help the hosts to update their times 
and you can do it without authenticating the system.  
Take a look at the following example. 
ntpdate 192.168.1.100 
01 Sept 12:50:49 ntpdate[627]: adjust time server 192.168.1.100 offset -

Metasploit is one of the most powerful exploit tools. Most of its resources can be found at: 
https://www.metasploit.com. It comes in two versions: commercial and free edition. 
There are no major differences in the two versions, so in this tutorial, we will be mostly 
using the Community version (free) of Metasploit. 
As an Ethical Hacker, you will be using “Kali Distribution” which has the Metasploit 
community version embedded in it along with other ethical hacking tools. But if you want 
to install Metasploit as a separate tool, you can easily do so on systems that run on Linux, 
Windows, or Mac OS X.  
The hardware requirements to install Metasploit are:  
 
2 GHz+ processor 
 
1 GB RAM available 
 
1 GB+ available disk space 
Matasploit can be used either with command prompt or with Web UI. 
To open in Kali, go to Applications -> Exploitation Tools -> metasploit.

After Metasploit starts, you will see the following screen. Highlighted in red underline is 
the version of Metasploit. 
 
Exploits of Metasploit 
From Vulnerability Scanner, we found that the Linux machine that we have for test is 
vulnerable to FTP service. Now, we will use the exploit that can work for us. The command 
is: 
use “exploit path” 
The screen will appear as follows: 
 
Then type mfs> show options in order to see what parameters you have to set in order 
to make it functional. As shown in the following screenshot, we have to set RHOST as the 
“target IP”. 
Ethical Hacking 
52 
 
 
We type msf> set RHOST 192.168.1.101 and msf>set RPORT 21 
 
Then, type mfs>run. If the exploit is successful, then it will open one session that you 
can interact with, as shown in the following screenshot. 
 
Metasploit Payloads 
Payload, in simple terms, are simple scripts that the hackers utilize to interact with a 
hacked system. Using payloads, they can transfer data to a victim system.  
Metasploit payloads can be of three types: 
 
Singles: Singles are very small and designed to create some kind of 
communication, then move to the next stage. For example, just creating a user. 
 
 
Staged: It is a payload that an attacker can use to upload a bigger file onto a 
victim system.  
Ethical Hacking 
53 
 
 
 
Stages: Stages are payload components that are downloaded by Stagers modules. 
The various payload stages provide advanced features with no size limits such 
as Meterpreter and VNC Injection. 
Payload Usage − Example 
We use the command show payloads. With this exploit, we can see the payloads that we 
can use, and it will also show the payloads that will help us upload /execute files onto a 
victim system.  
 
 
To set the payload that we want, we will use the following command:  
set PAYLOAD payload/path 
Set the listen host and listen port (LHOST, LPORT) which are the attacker IP and port. 
Then set remote host and port (RPORT, LHOST) which are the victim IP and port. 
Ethical Hacking 
54 
 
 
Type “exploit”. It will create a session as shown below:   
 
Now we can play with the system according to the settings that this payload offers.

Trojans are non-replication programs; they don’t reproduce their own codes by attaching 
themselves to other executable codes. They operate without the permissions or knowledge 
of the computer users.  
Trojans hide themselves in healthy processes. However we should underline that Trojans 
infect outside machines only with the assistance of a computer user, like clicking a file that 
comes attached with email from an unknown person, plugging USB without scanning, 
opening unsafe URLs.  
Trojans have several malicious functions: 
 
They create backdoors to a system. Hackers can use these backdoors to access a 
victim system and its files. A hacker can use Trojans to edit and delete the files 
present on a victim system, or to observe the activities of the victim. 
 
 
Trojans can steal all your financial data like bank accounts, transaction details, 
PayPal related information, etc. These are called Trojan-Banker. 
 
 
Trojans can use the victim computer to attack other systems using Denial of 
Services. 
 
 
Trojans can encrypt all your files and the hacker may thereafter demand money to 
decrypt them. These are Ransomware Trojans. 
 
 
They can use your phones to send SMS to third parties. These are called SMS 
Trojans. 
Trojan Information  
If you have found a virus and want to investigate further regarding its function, then we 
will recommend that you have a look at the following virus databases, which are offered 
generally by antivirus vendors. 
 
Kaspersky Virus database 
(http://www.kaspersky.com/viruswatchlite?hour_offset=-1)

Quick Tips 
 
Install a good antivirus and keep it updated.  
 
Don’t open email attachments coming from unknown sources.  
 
Don’t accept invitation from unknown people in social media. 
 
Don’t open URLs sent by unknown people or URLs that are in weird form.

TCP/IP Hijacking is when an authorized user gains access to a genuine network connection 
of another user. It is done in order to bypass the password authentication which is normally 
the start of a session. 
In theory, a TCP/IP connection is established as shown below:    
 
 
 
To hijack this connection, there are two possibilities:  
 
Find the seq which is a number that increases by 1, but there is no chance to 
predict it.  
 
 
The second possibility is to use the Man-in-the-Middle attack which, in simple 
words, is a type of network sniffing. For sniffing, we use tools like Wireshark or 
Ethercap. 
Example  
An attacker monitors the data transmission over a network and discovers the IP’s of two 
devices that participate in a connection. 
When the hacker discovers the IP of one of the users, he can put down the connection of 
the other user by DoS attack and then resume communication by spoofing the IP of the 
disconnected user.  
Shijack 
In practice, one of the best TCP/IP hijack tools is Shijack. It is developed using Python 
language 
and 
you 
can 
download 
it 
from 
the 
following 
link: 
https://packetstormsecurity.com/sniffers/shijack.tgz 
Here is an example of a Shijack command:

Quick Tip 
All unencrypted sessions are vulnerable to TCP/IP session hijacking, so you should be 
using encrypted protocols as much as possible. Or, you should use double authentication 
techniques to keep the session secured.

Email Hijacking, or email hacking, is a widespread menace nowadays. It works by using 
the following three techniques which are email spoofing, social engineering tools, or 
inserting viruses in a user computer. 
Email Spoofing  
In email spoofing, the spammer sends emails from a known domain, so the receiver thinks 
that he knows this person and opens the mail. Such mails normally contain suspicious 
links, doubtful content, requests to transfer money, etc.  
 
Social Engineering 
Spammers send promotional mails to different users, offering huge discount and tricking 
them to fill their personal data. You have tools available in Kali that can drive you to hijack 
an email.  
20.  Ethical Hacking – Email Hijacking 
Ethical Hacking 
60 
 
 
Email hacking can also be done by phishing techniques. See the following screenshot.  
 
Ethical Hacking 
61 
 
The links in the email may install malware on the user’s system or redirect the user to a 
malicious website and trick them into divulging personal and financial information, such 
as passwords, account IDs or credit card details.  
Phishing attacks are widely used by cybercriminals, as it is far easier to trick someone 
into clicking a malicious links in the email than trying to break through a computer’s 
defenses.  
Inserting Viruses in a User System 
The third technique by which a hacker can hijack your email account is by infecting your 
system with a virus or any other kind of malware. With the help of a virus, a hacker can 
take all your passwords. 
How to detect if your email has been hijacked? 
 
The recipients of spam emails include a bunch of people you know. 
 
 
You try to access your account and the password no longer works. 
 
 
You try to access the “Forgot Password” link and it does not go to the expected 
email. 
 
 
Your Sent Items folder contains a bunch of spams you are not aware of sending. 
Quick tips 
In case you think that your email got hijacked, then you need to take the following actions: 
 
Change the passwords immediately.  
 
 
Notify your friends not to open links that they receive from your email account. 
 
 
Contact the authorities and report that your account has been hacked.  
 
 
Install a good antivirus on your computer and update it. 
 
 
Set up double authentication password if it is supported. 
 
Ethical Hacking 
62 
 
We have passwords for emails, databases, computer systems, servers, bank accounts, 
and virtually everything that we want to protect. Passwords are in general the keys to get 
access into a system or an account.  
In general, people tend to set passwords that are easy to remember, such as their date of 
birth, names of family members, mobile numbers, etc. This is what makes the passwords 
weak and prone to easy hacking.  
One should always take care to have a strong password to defend their accounts from 
potential hackers. A strong password has the following attributes:  
 
Contains at least 8 characters  
 
A mix of letters, numbers, and special characters 
 
A combination of small and capital letters.  
Dictionary Attack 
In a dictionary attack, the hacker uses a predefined list of words from a dictionary to try 
and guess the password. If the set password is weak, then a dictionary attack can decode 
it quite fast.  
Hydra is a popular tool that is widely used for dictionary attacks. Take a look at the 
following screenshot and observe how we have used Hydra to find out the password of an 
FTP service.

Hybrid dictionary attack uses a set of dictionary words combined with extensions. For 
example, we have the word “admin” and combine it with number extensions such as 
“admin123”, “admin147”, etc.  
Crunch is a wordlist generator where you can specify a standard character set or a 
character set. Crunch can generate all possible combinations and permutations. This tool 
comes bundled with the Kali distribution of Linux. 
 
Brute-Force Attack 
In a brute-force attack, the hacker uses all possible combinations of letters, numbers, 
special characters, and small and capital letters to break the password. This type of attack 
has a high probability of success, but it requires an enormous amount of time to process 
all the combinations. A brute-force attack is slow and the hacker might require a system 
with high processing power to perform all those permutations and combinations faster.  
John the Ripper or Johnny is one of the powerful tools to set a brute-force attack and 
it comes bundled with the Kali distribution of Linux.

Rainbow Tables 
A rainbow table contains a set of predefined passwords that are hashed. It is a lookup 
table used especially in recovering plain passwords from a cipher text. During the process 
of password recovery, it just looks at the pre-calculated hash table to crack the password.  
The tables can be downloaded from http://project-rainbowcrack.com/table.htm  
RainbowCrack 1.6.1 is the tool to use the rainbow tables. It is available again in Kali 
distribution.

Quick Tips 
 
Don’t note down the passwords anywhere, just memorize them. 
 
Set strong passwords that are difficult to crack.  
 
Use a combination of alphabets, digits, symbols, and capital and small letters. 
 
Don’t set passwords that are similar to their usernames.

A wireless network is a set of two or more devices connected with each other via radio 
waves within a limited space range. The devices in a wireless network have the freedom 
to be in motion, but be in connection with the network and share data with other devices 
in the network. One of the most crucial point that they are so spread is that their 
installation cost is very cheap and fast than the wire networks. 
Wireless networks are widely used and it is quite easy to set them up. They use IEEE 
802.11 standards. A wireless router is the most important device in a wireless network 
that connects the users with the Internet.  
 
In a wireless network, we have Access Points which are extensions of wireless ranges 
that behave as logical switches.  
 
22.  Ethical Hacking – Wireless Hacking 
Ethical Hacking 
67 
 
Although wireless networks offer great flexibility, they have their security problems. A 
hacker can sniff the network packets without having to be in the same building where the 
network is located. As wireless networks communicate through radio waves, a hacker can 
easily sniff the network from a nearby location.  
Most attackers use network sniffing to find the SSID and hack a wireless network. When 
our wireless cards are converted in sniffing modes, they are called monitor mode. 
Kismet  
Kismet is a powerful tool for wireless sniffing that is found in Kali distribution. It can also 
be downloaded from its official webpage: http://www.kismetwireless.net/index.shtml   
Let’s see how it works. First of all, open a terminal and type kismet. Start the Kismet 
Server and click Yes, as shown in the following screenshot. 
 
As shown here, click the Start button.

It should display a screenshot as follows:  
 
It is important to note that your card should support monitoring mode, otherwise you 
will fail to monitor. 
Wired Equivalent Privacy 
Wired Equivalent Privacy (WEP) is a security protocol that was invented to secure wireless 
networks and keep them private. It utilizes encryption at the data link layer which forbids 
unauthorized access to the network. 
The key is used to encrypt the packets before transmission begins. An integrity check 
mechanism checks that the packets are not altered after transmission. 
Note that WEP is not entirely immune to security problems. It suffers from the following 
issues: 
 
CRC32 is not sufficient to ensure complete cryptographic integrity of a packet. 
 
It is vulnerable to dictionary attacks 
 
WEP is vulnerable to Denial of Services attacks too. 
WEPcrack 
WEPcrack is a popular tool to crack WEP passwords. It can be downloaded from:

Wireless DoS Attacks 
In a wireless environment, an attacker can attack a network from a distance and therefore, 
it is sometimes difficult to collect evidences against the attacker. 
The first type of DoS is Physical Attack. This type of attack is very basic and it is in the 
base of radio interferences which can be created even from cordless phones that operate 
in 2.4 GHz range. 
Another type is Network DoS Attack. As the Wireless Access Point creates a shared 
medium, it offers the possibility to flood the traffic of this medium toward the AP which 
will make its processing more slow toward the clients that attempt to connect. Such attacks 
can be created just by a ping flood DoS attack.

a 
popular 
DoS 
tool 
that

Low Orbit Ion Cannon (LOIC) is another popular tool for DoS attacks. 
 
Quick Tips 
To secure a wireless network, you should keep the following points in mind: 
 
Change the SSID and the network password regularly.  
 
Change the default password of access points. 
 
Don’t use WEP encryption. 
 
Turn off guest networking. 
 
Update the firmware of your wireless device.

Let us try to understand the concept of Social Engineering attacks through some examples.  
Example 1 
You must have noticed old company documents being thrown into dustbins as garbage. 
These documents might contain sensitive information such as Names, Phone Numbers, 
Account Numbers, Social Security Numbers, Addresses, etc. Many companies still use 
carbon paper in their fax machines and once the roll is over, its carbon goes into dustbin 
which may have traces of sensitive data. Although it sounds improbable, but attackers can 
easily retrieve information from the company dumpsters by pilfering through the garbage.  
Example 2 
An attacker may befriend a company personnel and establish good relationship with him 
over a period of time. This relationship can be established online through social networks, 
chatting rooms, or offline at a coffee table, in a playground, or through any other means. 
The attacker takes the office personnel in confidence and finally digs out the required 
sensitive information without giving a clue.  
Example 3 
A social engineer may pretend to be an employee or a valid user or an VIP by faking an 
identification card or simply by convincing employees of his position in the company. Such 
an attacker can gain physical access to restricted areas, thus providing further 
opportunities for attacks. 
Example 4 
It happens in most of the cases that an attacker might be around you and can do shoulder 
surfing while you are typing sensitive information like user ID and password, account 
PIN, etc. 
Phishing Attack 
A phishing attack is a computer-based social engineering, where an attacker crafts an 
email that appears legitimate. Such emails have the same look and feel as those received 
from the original site, but they might contain links to fake websites. If you are not smart 
enough, then you will type your user ID and password and will try to login which will result 
in failure and by that time, the attacker will have your ID and password to attack your 
original account. 
Quick Fix 
 
You should enforce a good security policy in your organization and conduct required 
trainings to make all the employees aware of the possible Social Engineering 
attacks and their consequences.  
 
 
Document shredding should be a mandatory activity in your company.  
23.  Ethical Hacking − Social Engineering 
Ethical Hacking 
73 
 
 
Make double sure that any links that you receive in your email is coming from 
authentic sources and that they point to correct websites. Otherwise you might end 
up as a victim of Phishing.  
 
 
Be professional and never share your ID and password with anybody else in any 
case.

A Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attack is an attempt to make an online service or 
a website unavailable by overloading it with huge floods of traffic generated from multiple 
sources. 
Unlike a Denial of Service (DoS) attack, in which one computer and one Internet 
connection is used to flood a targeted resource with packets, a DDoS attack uses many 
computers and many Internet connections, often distributed globally in what is referred to 
as a botnet. 
A large scale volumetric DDoS attack can generate a traffic measured in tens of Gigabits 
(and even hundreds of Gigabits) per second. We are sure your normal network will not be 
able to handle such traffic. 
What are Botnets? 
Attackers build a network of hacked machines which are known as botnets, by spreading 
malicious piece of code through emails, websites, and social media. Once these computers 
are infected, they can be controlled remotely, without their owners' knowledge, and used 
like an army to launch an attack against any target. 
 
 
 
 
24.  Ethical Hacking − DDOS Attacks 
Ethical Hacking 
75 
 
A DDoS flood can be generated in multiple ways. For example:  
 
Botnets can be used for sending more number of connection requests than a server 
can handle at a time.  
 
 
Attackers can have computers send a victim resource huge amounts of random 
data to use up the target's bandwidth.  
Due to the distributed nature of these machines, they can be used to generate distributed 
high traffic which may be difficult to handle. It finally results in a complete blockage of a 
service. 
Types of DDoS Attacks 
DDoS attacks can be broadly categorized into three categories: 
 
Volume-based Attacks 
 
Protocol Attacks 
 
Application Layer Attacks 
Volume-Based Attacks 
Volume-based attacks include TCP floods, UDP floods, ICMP floods, and other spoofed-
packet floods. These are also called Layer 3 & 4 Attacks. Here, an attacker tries to 
saturate the bandwidth of the target site. The attack magnitude is measured in Bits per 
Second (bps). 
 
UDP Flood – A UDP flood is used to flood random ports on a remote host with 
numerous UDP packets, more specifically port number 53. Specialized firewalls can 
be used to filter out or block malicious UDP packets. 
 
 
ICMP Flood - This is similar to UDP flood and used to flood a remote host with 
numerous ICMP Echo Requests. This type of attack can consume both outgoing and 
incoming bandwidth and a high volume of ping requests will result in overall system 
slowdown. 
 
 
HTTP Flood - The attacker sends HTTP GET and POST requests to a targeted web 
server in a large volume which cannot be handled by the server and leads to denial 
of additional connections from legitimate clients. 
 
 
Amplification Attack - The attacker makes a request that generates a large 
response which includes DNS requests for large TXT records and HTTP GET requests 
for large files like images, PDFs, or any other data files. 
Protocol Attacks 
Protocol attacks include SYN floods, Ping of Death, fragmented packet attacks, Smurf 
DDoS, etc. This type of attack consumes actual server resources and other resources like 
firewalls and load balancers. The attack magnitude is measured in Packets per Second. 
Ethical Hacking 
76 
 
 
DNS Flood – DNS floods are used for attacking both the infrastructure and a DNS 
application to overwhelm a target system and consume all its available network 
bandwidth. 
 
 
SYN Flood - The attacker sends TCP connection requests faster than the targeted 
machine can process them, causing network saturation. Administrators can tweak 
TCP stacks to mitigate the effect of SYN floods. To reduce the effect of SYN floods, 
you can reduce the timeout until a stack frees memory allocated to a connection, 
or selectively dropping incoming connections using a firewall or iptables. 
 
 
Ping of Death - The attacker sends malformed or oversized packets using a simple 
ping command. IP allows sending 65,535 bytes packets but sending a ping packet 
larger than 65,535 bytes violates the Internet Protocol and could cause memory 
overflow on the target system and finally crash the system. To avoid Ping of Death 
attacks and its variants, many sites block ICMP ping messages altogether at their 
firewalls. 
Application Layer Attacks 
Application Layer Attacks include Slowloris, Zero-day DDoS attacks, DDoS attacks that 
target Apache, Windows or OpenBSD vulnerabilities and more. Here the goal is to crash 
the web server. The attack magnitude is measured in Requests per Second. 
 
Application Attack - This is also called Layer 7 Attack, where the attacker 
makes excessive log-in, database-lookup, or search requests to overload the 
application. It is really difficult to detect Layer 7 attacks because they resemble 
legitimate website traffic. 
 
 
Slowloris - The attacker sends huge number of HTTP headers to a targeted web 
server, but never completes a request. The targeted server keeps each of these 
false connections open and eventually overflows the maximum concurrent 
connection pool, and leads to denial of additional connections from legitimate 
clients. 
 
 
NTP Amplification - The attacker exploits publically-accessible Network Time 
Protocol (NTP) servers to overwhelm the targeted server with User Datagram 
Protocol (UDP) traffic. 
 
 
Zero-day DDoS Attacks - A zero-day vulnerability is a system or application flaw 
previously unknown to the vendor, and has not been fixed or patched. These are 
new type of attacks coming into existence day by day, for example, exploiting 
vulnerabilities for which no patch has yet been released. 
How to Fix a DDoS Attack  
There are quite a few DDoS protection options which you can apply depending on the type 
of DDoS attack. 
Your DDoS protection starts from identifying and closing all the possible OS and application 
level vulnerabilities in your system, closing all the possible ports, removing unnecessary 
access from the system and hiding your server behind a proxy or CDN system. 
Ethical Hacking 
77 
 
If you see a low magnitude of the DDoS, then you can find many firewall-based solutions 
which can help you in filtering out DDoS based traffic. But if you have high volume of 
DDoS attack like in gigabits or even more, then you should take the help of a DDoS 
protection service provider that offers a more holistic, proactive and genuine approach. 
You must be careful while approaching and selecting a DDoS protection service provider. 
There are number of service providers who want to take advantage of your situation. If 
you inform them that you are under DDoS attack, then they will start offering you a variety 
of services at unreasonably high costs.  
We can suggest you a simple and working solution which starts with a search for a good 
DNS solution provider who is flexible enough to configure A and CNAME records for your 
website. Second, you will need a good CDN provider that can handle big DDoS traffic and 
provide you DDoS protection service as a part of their CDN package. 
Assume your server IP address is AAA.BBB.CCC.DDD. Then you should do the following 
DNS configuration: 
1. Create a A Record in DNS zone file as shown below with a DNS identifier, for 
example, ARECORDID and keep it secret from the outside world. 
 
2. Now ask your CDN provider to link the created DNS identifier with a URL, something 
like cdn.someotherid.domain.com. 
 
3. You will use the CDN URL cdn.someotherid.domain.com to create two CNAME 
records, the first one to point to www and the second record to point to @ as 
shown below. 
You can take the help from your system administrator to understand these points and 
configure your DNS and CDN appropriately. Finally, you will have the following 
configuration at your DNS. 
 
Now, let the CDN provider handle all type of DDoS attacks and your system will remain 
safe. But here the condition is that you should not disclose your system's IP address or A 
record identifier to anyone; else direct attacks will start again. 
Quick Fix 
DDoS attacks have become more common than ever before, and unfortunately, there is 
no quick fix for this problem. However, if your system is under a DDoS attack, then don’t 
panic and start looking into the matter step by step.

Cross-site scripting (XSS) is a code injection attack that allows an attacker to execute 
malicious JavaScript in another user's browser. 
The attacker does not directly target his victim. Instead, he exploits a vulnerability in a 
website that the victim visits, in order to get the website to deliver the malicious JavaScript 
for him. To the victim's browser, the malicious JavaScript appears to be a legitimate part 
of the website, and the website has thus acted as an unintentional accomplice to the 
attacker. These attacks can be carried out using HTML, JavaScript, VBScript, ActiveX, 
Flash, but the most used XSS is malicious JavaScript.  
These attacks also can gather data from account hijacking, changing of user settings, 
cookie theft/poisoning, or false advertising and create DoS attacks. 
Example 
Let’s take an example to understand how it works. We have a vulnerable webpage that 
we got by the metasploitable machine. Now we will test the field that is highlighted in 
red arrow for XSS.  
 
First of all, we make a simple alert script  
<script>  
alert(‘I am Vulnerable’)  
</script> 
 
25.  Ethical Hacking – Cross-Site Scripting 
Ethical Hacking 
79 
 
It will produce the following output:   
 
Types of XSS Attacks 
XSS attacks are often divided into three types: 
 
Persistent XSS, where the malicious string originates from the website's 
database. 
 
 
Reflected XSS, where the malicious string originates from the victim's request. 
 
 
DOM-based XSS, where the vulnerability is in the client-side code rather than the 
server-side code. 
Generally, cross-site scripting is found by vulnerability scanners so that you don’t have 
to do all the manual job by putting a JavaScript on it like  
<script>  
alert('XSS') 
</script> 
Burp Suite and acunetix are considered as the best vulnerability scanners. 
Quick Tip 
To prevent XSS attacks, keep the following points in mind: 
 
Check and validate all the form fields like hidden forms, headers, cookies, query 
strings. 
 
 
Implement a stringent security policy. Set character limitation in the input fields.

SQL injection is a set of SQL commands that are placed in a URL string or in data structures 
in order to retrieve a response that we want from the databases that are connected with 
the web applications. This type of attacks generally takes place on webpages developed 
using PHP or ASP.NET. 
An SQL injection attack can be done with the following intentions:  
 
To dump the whole database of a system,  
 
To modify the content of the databases, or  
 
To perform different queries that are not allowed by the application. 
This type of attack works when the applications don’t validate the inputs properly, before 
passing them to an SQL statement. Injections are normally placed put in address bars, 
search fields, or data fields. 
The easiest way to detect if a web application is vulnerable to an SQL injection attack is 
to use the " ‘ " character in a string and see if you get any error. 
Example 1 
Let’s try to understand this concept using a few examples. As shown in the following 
screenshot, we have used a " ‘ " character in the Name field.

Now, click the Login button. It should produce the following response: 
 
It means that the “Name” field is vulnerable to SQL injection. 
Example 2 
We have this URL: http://10.10.10.101/mutillidae/index.php?page=site-footer-xss-

And we want to test the variable “page” but observe how we have injected a " ‘ " character 
in the string URL.

When we press Enter, it will produce the following result which is with errors. 
 
SQLMAP 
SQLMAP is one of the best tools available to detect SQL injections. It can be downloaded 
from http://sqlmap.org/  
It comes pre-compiled in the Kali distribution. You can locate it at: Applications -> 
Database Assessment -> Sqlmap. 
After opening SQLMAP, we go to the page that we have the SQL injection and then get the 
header request. From the header, we run the following command in SQL: 
./sqlmap.py --headers="User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Ubuntu; Linux i686; 
rv:25.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/25.0" --cookie="security=low;

Quick Tips 
To prevent your web application from SQL injection attacks, you should keep the following 
points in mind:  
 
Unchecked user-input to database should not be allowed to pass through the 
application GUI.  
 
 
Every variable that passes into the application should be sanitized and validated. 
 
 
The user input which is passed into the database should be quoted.

Penetration Testing is a method that many companies follow in order to minimize their 
security breaches. This is a controlled way of hiring a professional who will try to hack 
your system and show you the loopholes that you should fix.  
Before doing a penetration test, it is mandatory to have an agreement that will explicitly 
mention the following parameters: 
 
what will be the time of penetration test,  
 
where will be the IP source of the attack, and  
 
what will be the penetration fields of the system. 
Penetration testing is conducted by professional ethical hackers who mainly use 
commercial, open-source tools, automate tools and manual checks. There are no 
restrictions; the most important objective here is to uncover as many security flaws as 
possible.  
Types of Penetration Testing 
We have five types of penetration testing:   
 
Black Box – Here, the ethical hacker doesn’t have any information regarding the 
infrastructure or the network of the organization that he is trying to penetrate. In 
black-box penetration testing, the hacker tries to find the information by his own 
means. 
 
 
Grey Box - It is a type of penetration testing where the ethical hacker has a partial 
knowledge of the infrastructure, like its domain name server.  
 
 
White Box -  In white-box penetration testing, the ethical hacker is provided with 
all the necessary information about the infrastructure and the network of the 
organization that he needs to penetrate. 
 
 
External Penetration Testing: This type of penetration testing mainly focuses on 
network infrastructure or servers and their software operating under the 
infrastructure. In this case, the ethical hacker tries the attack using public networks 
through the Internet. The hacker attempts to hack the company infrastructure by 
attacking their webpages, webservers, public DNS servers, etc. 
 
 
Internal Penetration Testing:  In this type of penetration testing, the ethical 
hacker is inside the network of the company and conducts his tests from there. 
Penetration testing can also cause problems such as system malfunctioning, system 
crashing, or data loss. Therefore, a company should take calculated risks before going 
ahead with penetration testing. The risk is calculated as follows and it is a management 
risk. 
RISK = Threat × Vulnerability 
27.  Ethical Hacking – Pen Testing 
Ethical Hacking 
86 
 
Example 
You have an online e-commerce website that is in production. You want to do a penetration 
testing before making it live. Here, you have to weigh the pros and cons first. If you go 
ahead with penetration testing, it might cause interruption of service. On the contrary, if 
you do not wish to perform a penetration testing, then you can run the risk of having an 
unpatched vulnerability that will remain as a threat all the time.  
Before doing a penetration test, it is recommended that you put down the scope of the 
project in writing. You should be clear about what is going to be tested. For example:  
 
Your company has a VPN or any other remote access techniques and you want to 
test that particular point.  
 
 
Your application has webservers with databases, so you might want to get it tested 
for SQL injection attacks which is one of the most crucial tests on a webserver. In 
addition, you can check if your webserver is immune to DoS attacks. 
Quick Tips 
Before going ahead with a penetration test, you should keep the following points in mind:  
 
First understand your requirements and evaluate all the risks.  
 
 
Hire a certified person to conduct penetration test because they are trained to apply 
all the possible methods and techniques to uncover possible loopholes in a network 
or web application.  
 
 
Always sign an agreement before doing a penetration test.
