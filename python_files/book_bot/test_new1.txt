[Lord of the Rings series visions of corrupt and totalitarian power. At Stanford he started  a libertarian newspaper the Stanford to preach the gospel of freedom.      In 1998 Thiel cofounded the company that would become PayPal which he sold  to eBay for $1.5 billion in 2002. Today Thiel runs a multi-billion-dollar hedge fund  Clarium and a venture capital firm Founder’s Fund which invests in software  companies throughout Silicon Valley. Thiel has made some legendarily good  picks—among them Facebook in which he was the first outside investor. (He’s also  made some bad ones—Clarium has lost billions in the last few years.) But for Thiel  investing is more than a day job. It’s an avocation. “By starting a new Internet business  an entrepreneur may create a new world” Thiel says. “The hope of the Internet is that  these new worlds will impact and force change on the existing social and political order.”      His comments raise the question of what kind of change Thiel would like to see.  While many billionaires are fairly circumspect about their political views Thiel has been  vocal—and it’s safe to say that there are few with views as unusual as Thiel’s. “Peter  wants to end the inevitability of death and taxes” Thiel’s sometime collaborator Patri  Friedman (grandson of Milton) told Wired. “I mean talk about aiming high!”      In an essay posted on the libertarian Cato Institute’s Web site Thiel describes  why he believes that “freedom and democracy are no longer compatible.” “Since 1920”  he writes “the vast increase in welfare beneficiaries and the extension of the franchise to  women—two constituencies that are notoriously tough for libertarians—have rendered  the notion of ‘capitalist democracy’ into an oxymoron.” Then he outlines his hopes for  the future: space exploration “sea-steading” which involves building movable  microcountries on the open ocean and cyberspace. Thiel has poured millions into  technologies to sequence genes and prolong life. He’s also focused on preparing for the  Singularity the moment a few decades from now when some futurists believe that  humans and machines are likely to meld.      In an interview he argues that should the Singularity arrive one would be well  advised to be on the side of the computers: “Certainly we would hope that [an artificially  intelligent computer] would be friendly to human beings. At the same time I don’t think  you’d want to be known as one of the human beings that is against computers and makes  a living being against computers.”      If all this sounds a little fantastical it doesn’t worry Thiel. He’s focused on the  long view. “Technology is at the center of what will determine the course of the 21st  century” he says. “There are aspects of it that are great and aspects that are terrible and  there are some real choices humans have to make about which technologies to foster and  which ones we should be more careful about.”      Peter Thiel is entitled to his idiosyncratic views of course but they’re worth  paying attention to because they increasingly shape the world we all live in. There are  0c102    only four other people on the Facebook board besides Mark Zuckerberg; Thiel is one of  them and Zuckerberg publicly describes him as a mentor. “He helped shape the way I  think about the business” Zuckerberg said in a 2006 Bloomberg News interview. As  Thiel says we have some big decisions to make about technology. And as for how those  decisions get made? “I have little hope” he writes “that voting will make things better.”      “What Game Are You Playing?”         Of course not all engineers and geeks have the views about democracy and  freedom that Peter Thiel does—he’s surely an outlier. Craig Newmark the founder of the  free Web site craigslist spends most of his time arguing for “geek values” that include  service and public-spiritedness. Jimmy Wales and the editors at Wikipedia work to make  human knowledge free to everyone. The filtering goliaths make huge contributions here  as well: The democratic ideal of an enlightened capable citizenry is well served by the  broader set of relationships Facebook allows me to manage and the mountains of  formerly hard-to-access research papers and other public information that Google has  freed.      But the engineering community can do more to strengthen the Internet’s civic  space. And to get a sense of the path ahead I talked to Scott Heiferman.      Heiferman the founder of MeetUp.com is soft-spoken in a Midwestern sort of  way. That’s fitting because he grew up in Homewood Illinois a small town on the  outskirts of Chicago. “It was a stretch to call it suburban” he says. His parents operated a  paint store.      As a teenager Heiferman devoured material about Steve Jobs eating up the story  about how Jobs wooed a senior executive from Pepsi by asking him if he wanted to  change the world or sell sugar water. “Throughout my life” he told me “I’ve had a  love-hate relationship with advertising.” At the University of Iowa in the early 1990s  Heiferman studied engineering and marketing but at night he ran a radio show called  Advertorial Infotainment in which he would remix and cut advertisements together to  create a kind of sound art. He put the finished shows online and encouraged people to  send in ads to remix and the attention got him his first job managing the Web site at  Sony .com.      After a few years as Sony’s “interactive-marketing frontiersman” Heiferman  founded i-traffic one of the major early advertising companies of the Web. Soon i-traffic  was the agency of record for clients like Disney and British Airways. But although the  company was growing quickly he was dissatisfied. The back of his business card had a  mission statement about connecting people with brands they’d love but he was  increasingly uncertain that was a worthy endeavor—perhaps he was selling sugar water  after all. He left the company in 2000.      For the remainder of the year and into 2001 Heiferman was in a funk. “I was  0c103    exhibiting what you could call being depressed” he says. When he heard the first word of  the World Trade Center attacks on 9/11 he ran up to his lower-Manhattan rooftop and  watched in horror. “I talked to more strangers in the next three days” he says “than in  the previous five years of living in New York.”      Shortly after the attacks Heiferman came across the blog post that changed his  life. It argued that the attacks as awful as they were might bring Americans back  together in their civic life and referenced the bestselling book Bowling Alone. Heiferman  bought a copy and read it cover to cover. “I became captivated” he says “by the question  of whether we could use technology to rebuild and strengthen community.” MeetUp.com  a site that makes it easy for local groups to meet face-to-face was his answer and today  MeetUp serves over 79000 local groups that do that. There’s the Martial Arts MeetUp in  Orlando and the Urban Spirituality MeetUp in Barcelona and the Black Singles MeetUp  in Houston. And Heiferman is a happier man.      “What I learned being in the ad business” he says “is that people can just go a  long time without asking themselves what they should put their talent towards. You’re  playing a game and you know the point of the game is to win. But what game are you  playing? What are you optimizing for? If you’re playing the game of trying to get the  maximum downloads of your app you’ll make the better farting app.”      “We don’t need more things” he says. “People are more magical than iPads!  Your relationships are not media. Your friendships are not media. Love is not media.” In  his low-key way Heiferman is getting worked up.      Evangelizing this view of technology—that it ought to do something meaningful  to make our lives more fulfilling and to solve the big problems we face—isn’t as easy as  it might seem. In addition to MeetUp more generally Scott founded the New York Tech  MeetUp a group of ten thousand software engineers who meet every month to preview  new Web sites. At a recent meeting Scott made an impassioned plea for the assembled  group to focus on solving the problems that matter—education health care the  environment. It didn’t get a very good reception—in fact he was just about booed off the  stage. “‘We just want to do cool stuff’ was the attitude” Scott told me later. “ ‘Don’t  bother me with this politics stuff.’ ”      Technodeterminists like to suggest that technology is inherently good. But despite  what Kevin Kelly says technology is no more benevolent than a wrench or a screwdriver.  It’s only good when people make it do good things and use it in good ways. Melvin  Kranzberg a professor who studies the history of technology put it best nearly thirty  years ago and his statement is now known as Kranzberg’s first law: “Technology is  neither good or bad nor is it neutral.”      For better or worse programmers and engineers are in a position of remarkable  power to shape the future of our society. They can use this power to help solve the big  problems of our age—poverty education disease—or they can as Heifer-man says  make a better farting app. They’re entitled to do either of course. But it’s disingenuous to  0c104    have it both ways—to claim your enterprise is great and good when it suits you and claim  you’re a mere sugar-water salesman when it doesn’t.      Actually building an informed and engaged citizenry—in which people have the  tools to help manage not only their own lives but their own communities and  societies—is one of the most fascinating and important engineering challenges. Solving it  will take a great deal of technical skill mixed with humanistic understanding—a real feat.  We need more programmers to go beyond Google’s famous slogan “Don’t be evil.” We  need engineers who will do good.      And we need them soon: If personalization remains on its current trajectory as  the next chapter describes the near future could be stranger and more problematic than  many of us would imagine.      7         What You Want Whether You Want It or Not      There will always be plenty of things to compute in the detailed affairs of millions of  people doing complicated things.  —computing pioneer Vannevar Bush 1945        All collected data had come to a final end. Nothing was left to be collected. But all  collected data had yet to be completely correlated and put together in all possible  relationships. —from Isaac Asimov’s short story “The Last Question”          I recently received a friend invitation on Facebook from someone whose name I  didn’t recognize a curvy-figured girl with big eyes and thick lashes. Clicking to figure  out who she was (and I’ll admit to look more closely) I read over her profile. It didn’t  tell me a lot about her but it seemed like the profile of someone I might plausibly know.  A few of our interests were the same.      I looked again at the eyes. They were a little too big.      In fact when I looked more closely I realized her profile picture wasn’t even a  photograph—it had been rendered by a 3-D graphics program. There was no such person.  My new attractive would-be friend was a figment of software crawling through friend  connections to harvest data from Facebook users. Even the list of movies and books she  liked appeared to have been ripped from the lists of her “friends.”      For lack of a better word let’s call her an advertar—a virtual being with a  0c105    commercial purpose. As the filter bubble’s membrane becomes thicker and harder to  penetrate advertars could become a powerful adaptive strategy. If I only get the news  from my code and my friends the easiest way to get my attention might be friends who  are code.      The technologies that support personalization will only get more powerful in the  years ahead. Sensors that can pick up new personal signals and data streams will become  even more deeply embedded in the surface of everyday life. The server farms that support  the Googles and Amazons will grow while the processors inside them shrink; that  computing power will be unleashed to make increasingly precise guesses about our  preferences and even our interior lives. Personalized “augmented reality” technologies  will project an overlay over our experience of the real world not just the digital one.  Even Nicholas Negroponte’s intelligent agents may make a comeback. “Markets are  strong forces” says Bill Joy the legendary programmer who cofounded Sun  Microsystems. “They take you somewhere very quickly. And if where they take you is  not where you want to go you’ve got a problem.”      In 2002 the sci-fi movie Minority Report featured personalized holographic  advertisements that accosted pedestrians as they walked down the street. In Tokyo the  first Minority Report–style personalized billboard has gone up outside of the NEC  corporation’s headquarters (minus for now the holography). It’s powered by the  company’s PanelDirector software which scans the faces of passersby and matches them  to a database of ten thousand stored photos to make guesses about their age and gender.  When a young woman steps in front of the display it responds instantly by showing her  ads tailored to her. IBM’s on the case too; its prototype advertising displays use remotely  readable identity cards to greet viewers by name.   Thiel cofounded Paypal.]
